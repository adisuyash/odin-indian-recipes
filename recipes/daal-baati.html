                    <li class="dish">
                        Pre-heat oven to 190 degree Celsius (375 degree Fahrenheit). Sieve whole wheat flour in a large
                        bowl. Add rava, baking soda, 4 tablespoons ghee (or cooking oil) and salt (do not add salt if
                        you are preparing Bati for Churma).</li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Mix all ingredients well using your hand. The mixture will turn crumbly as shown in
                        the photo.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Add milk in small quantities and bind the stiff dough. It should be stiffer than
                        paratha dough. Cover it and rest it for 10-minutes.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Divide dough into 8-equal portions and make round shaped balls from it. Don't worry
                        if balls have few cracks, it is normal. Gently press each ball in-between your palms and flatten
                        it into a thick pattie. Arrange them on a baking tray with a small gap around them.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Place baking tray in the pre-heated oven and bake raw Batis at 375 F (190 C) until
                        bottom surface turns light brown, it will take around 12-15 minutes. Take it out from the oven
                        (be careful) and flip each Bati upside-down to cook the other surface. Place baking tray in oven
                        again and bake for another 10-12 minutes. Take the tray out from the oven.</li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Take melted ghee in a small bowl. Dip each Bati in it and transfer to a plate. You
                        can also apply ghee on the surface of bati using a brush.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Squash baked Bati with your hand and drizzle some ghee over it. Pour Panchmel Dal
                        over it and serve with Rajasthani Churma, Garlic Chutney and papad.</li><br>

                <p class="tips"><strong>Tips and Variations:</strong></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li class="dish">How to Cook Bati using Gas Tandoor? – Heat the Gas Tandoor, place raw Batis on the
                        grill of a Gas Tandoor and cook on medium flame for around 20-25 minutes. Flip once in between
                        to cook from both sides.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">How to Cook Bati without Oven or Tandoor? – Deep fry them in cooking oil over
                        medium-low flame until both sides turn light golden brown. Since they are thick, it and will
                        take more time to cook from inside and must be cooked on medium-low flame.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">Different brands of oven have different settings, so adjust the cooking time
                        according to it.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="dish">We recommend to use Ghee instead of cooking oil for preparing dough as it gives
                        both taste and crisp yet melt in mouth texture to Bati. Don’t reduce its quantity for preparing
                        the dough.
                    </li><br>
                </ul>
                <p class="taste"><strong>Taste: </strong><span class="taste">Crisp from outside and soft from
                        inside</span></p>
                <p class="taste"><strong>Serving Ideas: </strong><span class="taste"> Break each Bati into small pieces
                        using your hand, pour panchratna dal over it, drizzle some ghee over it and serve with
                        Rajasthani Churma as a wholesome meal.</span>
