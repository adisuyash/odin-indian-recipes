              mash cooked veggies into a texture you like - with small chunks or
              smooth with no chunks at all. The texture of your bhaji would
              depend on how you mashed the veggies.

              Add veggies like brinjal, broccoli, french beans, sweet corn etc
              per your preference for variation in taste and texture.

            <li class="dish">
              Add a small piece of beetroot along with vegetables while boiling
              to get the deep red color of bhaji. Additionally use Kashmiri red
              chilli powder instead of regular red chilli powder.
